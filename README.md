Terraform â€“ Part 1 ðŸš€
This project is part of my Terraform learning journey. In this repo, Iâ€™m exploring the basics of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform.

What I Learned
What Terraform is and why itâ€™s used
Core concepts: Providers, Resources, State files
Writing the first Terraform configuration
Initializing and applying infrastructure
Destroying resources safely

How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Mujtaba-DevOps/Terraform-Part-1.git
cd Terraform-Part-1

Initialize Terraform:
terraform init

Apply the configuration:
terraform apply

Git Commands I Used
For version control, hereâ€™s the basic workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "my first terraform code"
git push
